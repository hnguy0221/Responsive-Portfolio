                    <p class="paragraph">My name is Hai Nguyen. I came to the U.S.A in 1978 as a refugee from Vietnam. I attended Lakewood High School (Go Tigers) in Lakewood, Colorado and University of Colorado at Denver. I currently live in Westminster, Colorado with my wife and three boys, ages 11, 20, and 22.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">In my career, I started out as a Software Test after college and worked for Storage Tech Corporation (STC) which is now Oracle Corporation. I left STC after eight years and joined McKesson as a Software Engineer. After almost twenty years, my tenure with McKesson finally came to an end on March 31st, 2017 as I was let go as part of the company's downsizing. My background includes C, C++, Java, Web Prgramming and Scripting, Linux, Unix, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, T-SQL, and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">I am currently pursuing a full stack web development certificate from University of Denver. My interests are web development, football, running, biking, and fishing. In my spare time, I volunteer at Denver Rescue Mission, and at a local church in which I am a member.</p>
